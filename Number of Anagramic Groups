Number of Anagramic Groups:

You are given N strings of length M, count the number of anagramic groups. An anagramic group is a list of strings that are anagrams of each other.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. In each test case, the first line contains N - the number of strings and M - the length of each string, separated by a space. The N subsequent lines each contain a string of length M.

Output Format
For each test case, print the count of the number of anagramic groups in the given N strings, separated by a new line.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 1000
'a' <= str[i] <= 'z'

Example
Input
2
5 4
arts
rank
star
rant
rats
9 5
tesla
start
slate
salte
tarts
aster
arson
astle
norse

Output
3
5

Explanation

Test-Case 1
The strings "arts", "star" and "rats" can be grouped together because they are anagrams of each other.
The total number of such groups is 3 and the groups are {"arts", "rats", "star"}, {"rant"} and {"rank"}.

code:
from collections import defaultdict
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n,m=list(map(int,input().split()))
    s=defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(n):
        term=input().strip()
        sorted_term=''.join(sorted(term))
        s[sorted_term].append(term)
    print(len(s))
