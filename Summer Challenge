Summer Challenge:

During the summer break for the "Smart Interviews" course, the instructor wants to ensure that students maintain their problem-solving skills. To achieve this, a sequence of N contests has been created. Each contest consists a specific set of problems.

The student has the capability of solving K problems per day. Each day, he has to pick the contest that has the highest number of problems. If there are several contests with the same number of problems, the student picks the one with the earlier occurrence in the sequence. The student cannot pick multiple contests on a single day, he can only choose a single contest on a day.

The student continues to pick contests until all contest problems are solved. Determine the order in which contests will be completed by the student.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers N - the number of contests and K - the capability of the student to solve the problems in a single day. The second line of each test case contains N integers, denoting the number of problems in each contest.

Output Format
Print the indices of the array in which the student completes all the N-contests.

Constraints 
30 points
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= A[i], K <= 100

70 points
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i], K <= 109

Example
Input
3
3 2
1 2 3
2 3
1 1
4 3
2 8 3 5

Output
2 1 3
1 2
3 1 2 4

Explanation

Test Case 1:
On each day the number of problems in the contest change as follows: [1,2,3]→[1,2,1]→[1,0,1]→[0,0,1]→[0,0,0].

Test Case 2:
On each day the number of problems in the contest change as follows: [1,1]→[0,1]→[0,0].

Test Case 3:
On each day the number of problems in the contest change as follows: [2,8,3,5]→[2,5,3,5]→[2,2,3,5]→[2,2,3,2]→[2,2,0,2]→[0,2,0,2]→[0,0,0,2]→[0,0,0,0].

code:
def Summer_Challenge(n,k,ar):
    contest = []
    for i in range(n):
        day = -(ar[i])%k
        contest.append((day,i))
    contest.sort()
    ans =[idx+1 for _,idx in contest]
    return ans
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n,k = map(int,input().split())
    ar = list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(*Summer_Challenge(n,k,ar))
