Rectangular Area Under Histogram:

Given the height of adjacent buildings, find the largest rectangular area possible, where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous buildings. For simplicity, assume that all buildings have the same width and the width is 1 unit.
Note that the sides of the rectangle have to be parallel to the axes.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It is followed by 2T lines - the first line contains N - the number of buildings. The second line contains the height of the buildings.

Output Format
For each test case, print the area of the largest possible rectangle, separated by a newline.

Constraints
50 points
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= A[i] <= 1000

100 points
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 104

Explanation

Example 1:

The maximum rectangular area is obtained by selecting the highlighted buildings (5, 5, 6, 7), corresponding to the indices 6 to 9. The area is calculated as 5 * 4 = 20. [a * b means rectangle with height a and width b]

Example 2:
The maximum rectangular area is obtained by selecting the buildings of indices 1 and 2. The area is calculated as 11 * 2 = 22. [a * b means rectangle with height a and width b]

code:
def next_smaller(a,n):
    res=[n]*n
    stack=[]
    for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
        while len(stack)!=0 and a[stack[-1]]>=a[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if len(stack)!=0:
            res[i]=stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
    return res
def prev_smaller(a,n):
    res=[-1]*n
    stack=[]
    for i in range(n):
        while len(stack)!=0 and a[stack[-1]]>=a[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if len(stack)!=0:
            res[i]=stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
    return res
def HistogramArea(n,a):
    l=prev_smaller(a,n)
    r=next_smaller(a,n)
    ans=float('-inf')
    for i in range(n):
        ans=max(ans,(r[i]-l[i]-1)*a[i])
    return ans
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(HistogramArea(n,a))
