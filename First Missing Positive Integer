First Missing Positive Integer: 

You are given an array of integers of size N. Find the first positive integer that is missing from the array.

Note: 
 Try solving in O(N) time without using any additional space, except the input array.  Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains one integer N - the size of the array. The second line contains N integers - the elements of the array.

Output Format
For each test case, print the first missing positive integer, separated by a newline.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
-105 <= A[i] <= 105

Example
Input
2
5
2 0 1 5 -3
6
2 -7 3 1 8 -1

Output
3
4

Explanation

Example 1: The first missing positive integer is 3, as 1 and 2 are present in the array.

code:
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    a=sorted(a)
    ans=1
    for i in a:
        if i==ans:
            ans+=1
        elif i>ans:
            break
    print(ans)
