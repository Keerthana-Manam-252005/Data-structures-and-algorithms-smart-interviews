Express as a Power b:

Given a number, check if the number can be expressed as pow(a, b) where both a and b should be greater than 1.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by T lines, each line contains a single integer N.

Output Format
For each test case, print "Yes" if N can be expressed as pow(a, b), and print "No" otherwise, separated by a new line.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= T <= 104
1 <= N <= 106

70 points
1 <= T <= 106
1 <= N <= 108

code:
import math

powers = set()
for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(max_n))+1):
    val = i*i
    while val<=max_n:
        powers.add(val)
        val*=i
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    ans = "Yes" if n in powers else "No"
    print(ans)
