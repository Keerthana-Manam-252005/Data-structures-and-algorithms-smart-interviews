Repeated Numbers:

You are given an array of N elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to N-2. All elements occur once except two numbers, which occur twice. Your task is to find the two repeating numbers.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - the size of the array and second line contains the elements of the array.

Output Format
Print the 2 repeated numbers in sorted manner, for each test case, separated by new line.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= T <= 100
4 <= N <= 103

70 points
1 <= T <= 100
4 <= N <= 106

Example
Input
2
8
1 3 2 3 4 6 5 5
10
1 5 2 8 1 4 7 4 3 6

Output
3 5
1 4

code:
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    a=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
    count=[0]*(n+2)
    repeating=[]
    for i in a:
        count[i]+=1
    for i in range(1,n+2):
        if count[i]==2:
            repeating.append(i)
    print(*repeating)
