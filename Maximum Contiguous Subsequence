Maximum Contiguous Subsequence:

Given an array, find the length of the longest subsequence whose elements can be re-arranged in a strictly increasing contiguous order. The difference between 2 adjacent elements in the subsequence, after re-arrangement, should be exactly 1.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. It's followed by 2T lines. The first line of each test case contains N - size of the array. The next line contains N integers - the elements of the array.

Output Format
For each test case, print the length of the longest subsequence, separated by a new line.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 10000
-100000 <= ar[i] <= 100000

Explanation

Test Case-1:
Subsequence is: -22, -24, -23.

Test Case-2: 
Subsequence is: 31, 33, 30, 32.

Test Case-3: 
Subsequence is: 6, 5 or 3, 2.


code:
def maxContiguousSubsequence(a,n):
    a=sorted(a)
    res=1
    count=1
    for i in range(1,n):
        if a[i]==a[i-1]:
            continue
        if a[i]==a[i-1]+1:
            count+=1
        else:
            count=1
        res=max(res,count)
    return res
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(maxContiguousSubsequence(a,n))
