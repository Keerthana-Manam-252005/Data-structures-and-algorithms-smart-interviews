Number of Dice Rolls for Given Sum:

Given a standard 6-sided dice, find the number of ways to get a sum of N.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - number of test cases. It's followed by T lines, each line contains N - the desired sum.

Output Format
For each test case, print the number of ways to get a sum of N, separated by new line. Since the answer can be very large, print answer % 1000000007 [1e9+7].

Constraints
1 <= T <= 105
1 <= N <= 105

Example
Input
5
3
11
7
5
500

Output
4
976
63
16
765996555

Explanation

Example 1:
You can get a sum of 3 in the ways:
(1,1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3)


code:
m = 1000000007
def dice(n):
    dp = [1]*(n+1)
    dp[0]=1
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        res = 0
        for j in range(1,7):
            if (i-j)>=0:
                res = res + dp[i-j]
        dp[i] = res % m
    return dp
dp = dice(10**5)
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    print(dp[n])
