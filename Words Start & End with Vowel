Words Start & End with Vowel:

Given a list of words containing lowercase / uppercase English alphabets, you have to count the number of words between ith word and jth word that start and end with vowels.

Input Format
First line of input contains N - number of words. The next line contains N words, separated by space. The next line contains Q - number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains two integers i and j, separated by space.

Output Format
For each query, print the count for given [i, j], separated by newline.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= Q <= 103

70 points
1 <= N <= 104
1 <= Q <= 105

General Constraints
0 <= i <= j < N
1 <= len(word) <= 10

Example
Input
10
smart Ursula eerie code abyss Arjuna Expasito data Ace hacker
3
1 3
5 8
3 4

Output
2
3
0

Explanation

Test Case 1:
The words that start and end with vowels between [1,3] ie [Ursula, eerie, code] are: "Ursula", "eerie"

Test Case 2:
The words that start and end with vowels between [5,8] are: "Arjuna", "Expasito", "Ace"

Test Case 3:
There are no words that start and end with vowels between [3,4].

code:
def seeVowel(vowel,word):
    return word[0] in vowel and word[-1] in vowel
n=int(input())
s=input().strip().split()
q=int(input())
vowel='aeiouAEIOU'
prefix_sum=[0]*n
prefix_sum[0]=seeVowel(vowel,s[0])
for i in range(1,n):
    prefix_sum[i]=prefix_sum[i-1]+seeVowel(vowel,s[i])
for _ in range(q):
    i,j=map(int,input().split())
    if i==0:
        print(prefix_sum[j])
    else:
        print(prefix_sum[j]-prefix_sum[i-1])
