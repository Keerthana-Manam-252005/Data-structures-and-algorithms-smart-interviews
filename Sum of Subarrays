Sum of Subarrays:

Given an array of integers, answer queries of the form: [i, j]: Print the sum of array elements from A[i] to A[j], both inclusive.

Input Format
The first line of input contains the N-size of the array. The next line contains N integers - elements of the array. The next line contains Q - number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains 2 space-separated indexes: i and j.

Output Format
For each query, print the sum of array elements from A[i] to A[j], both inclusive, separated by a new line.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= N, Q <= 10000

70 points
1 <= N, Q <= 500000

General Constraints
-109 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= i <= j <= N-1

code:
n=int(input())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
q=int(input())
sumA=dict()
sumA[0]=a[0]
for ele in range(1,n):
    sumA[ele]=sumA[ele-1]+a[ele]
for _ in range(q):
    i,j=map(int,input().split())
    try:
        print(sumA[j]-sumA[i-1])
    except:
        print(sumA[j])
