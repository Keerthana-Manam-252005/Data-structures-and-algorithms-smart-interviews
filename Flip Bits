Flip Bits:

You are given two numbers A and B. Write a program to count the number of bits to be flipped to change the number A to the number B. Flipping a bit of a number means changing a bit from 1 to 0 or vice versa.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains 2 integers A and B, separated by space.

Output Format
For each test case, print the number of bit flips required to convert A to B, separated by a new line.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100000
0 <= A, B <= 109

Example
Input
4
20 10
16 8
1 153
549 24

Output
4
2
3
6

code:
def flip_bits(a,b):
    c = a^b 
    count = 0
    while c:
        count+= c & 1
        c>>=1
    return count
t = int(input())
res = []
for _ in range(t):
    a,b = map(int,input().split())
    ans = flip_bits(a,b)
    res.append(ans)
for i in res:
    print(i)
