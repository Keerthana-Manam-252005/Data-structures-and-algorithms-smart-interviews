Changing Directories:

Zack is learning Operating Systems. He came across the following commands:
cd - changes the location of the working directory, and
pwd - display the present working directory

If the cd parameter contains "..", that means you have to step back one directory. The path of directories is separated by slashes "/". The default root directory is "/". Your task is to print the current working directory, for each "pwd" command.

Input Format
The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line of input contains N - number of commands. It is followed by N lines, each containing either a "cd <path>" or a "pwd" command. Each "cd" command will end with a "/".

Output Format
For each "pwd" command, print the present working directory, separated by a new line. Print a newline between the output of test cases.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= len(path) <= 200
path[i] âˆˆ ('a' - 'z', '.', '/')

Example
Input
2
8
pwd
cd /Users/Guest/
pwd
cd ../Admin/Desktop/
pwd
cd /Users/Guest/Desktop/
cd os/labs/
pwd
6
cd /sem/networks/labs/
pwd
cd ../../os/labs/../slides/
pwd
cd /
pwd

Output
/
/Users/Guest/
/Users/Admin/Desktop/
/Users/Guest/Desktop/os/labs/

/sem/networks/labs/
/sem/os/slides/
/

code:
def normalize_path(pathStack):
    return '/' + '/'.join(pathStack) + '/' if pathStack else '/'
def changing_Directories(command):
    pathStack=[]
    res=[]
    for i in command:
        if i=='pwd':
            res.append(normalize_path(pathStack))
        elif i.startswith('cd '):
            path = i[3:]
            if path.startswith('/'):
                pathStack=[]
                path=path[1:]
            parts = path.strip('/').split('/')
            for part in parts:
                if part=='..':
                    if pathStack:
                        pathStack.pop()
                elif part:
                    pathStack.append(part)
    return res
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    command = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    ans = changing_Directories(command)
    for i in ans:
        print(i)
    print()
